# Robust Contact Manager

## 🧠 Design Approach
The program separates core logic from user interaction to support testing and maintainability. Custom exceptions ensure clear error reporting, and unit tests validate core functionality.---

## 🧩 What the Program Does

The program allows users to:
- Add, find, and delete contacts stored in a dictionary  
- Handle invalid inputs without crashing  
- Raise a custom error when trying to add a duplicate contact  
- Print user-friendly messages for each operation

## ⚙️ How to Run the Program

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd contact-manager
